# Graak: rules for coding agents

Graak (github.com/ariel-aram/graak) packages a JavaScript or TypeScript program (server, site, CLI, bot) into one standalone
executable for every device, legacy Windows and 32-bit systems included, with no Node.js on the device. It does that on its own
engine (quickjs-ng plus a C host with mbedTLS, miniz, wasm3 and SQLite, and a Node-shaped JavaScript layer), or on a
Node.js runtime where one exists for the target. Bun projects are built with Graak as the sidekick. The ForgeScript
adapter under `src/forgescript` is optional; nothing else depends on it.

This file is the shared rulebook. `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` import it and add only what is specific to that tool.
OpenCode reads this file directly.

## What matters most

1. **The legacy Windows path** (Windows XP, Vista, 7, 32-bit builds) is the priority. The goal is that no device is excluded
   from running a Graak binary. When a change helps a modern target and hurts XP/Vista/7 or 32-bit, it is wrong.
2. **"Can't" is a gap to engineer around.** Every module, addon and API should run on every target. Do not declare a limit,
   stub a feature silently, or return a plausible fake. If something truly cannot work, say so in the code path (a clear error)
   and in the README's limits, and say what was tried.
3. **Verify against the real thing.** Behaviour is checked by running the same program under real Node.js and under the packaged host, and requiring identical output. "It runs" is not the bar; "indistinguishable" is.

## Layout

- `src/compiler`: collect the project, convert it, package it (`BinaryPackager` picks the strategy; `QuickJsPackager` is the
  Graak engine; `SeaPackager` and `PortablePackager` are the Node.js paths).
- `src/structures` (targets, errors), `src/runtime` (launchers and polyfills for Node.js builds), `src/integrations`
  (database driver knowledge), `src/forgescript` (optional adapter), `src/cli.ts`.
- `quickjs/native`: the C host (`graak_native.c`, `napi.c`, `fg_*.c`, `build.sh`, `win-compat/` shims for old Windows).
- `quickjs/runtime`: the host's JavaScript standard library. `node-compat.js` is the entry. Every runtime file the host needs
  must be listed in `RUNTIME_FILES` in `src/compiler/QuickJsPackager.ts`; the Intl data files are picked up by name.
- `quickjs/prebuilt`: the shipped hosts (`hosts/*.gz`) and Windows DLLs, with a manifest that hashes `quickjs/native`.
- `test/`: Node's test runner; `test/fixtures/web/*.cjs` are the differential corpora; `dist/` is committed.
- `tools/`: `build-prebuilts.js`, `engine-conformance.js`, `gen-intl-data.js`, `gen-intl-collation.js`.

## Commands

```sh
bun install
bun run typecheck && bun run build && bun run check     # tsc --noEmit, tsc (writes dist/), biome
bun run test                                      # tsc, then every test/**/*.test.ts
node --test test/webRuntime.test.ts            # one suite while iterating
bun run prebuilts                                 # rebuild the shipped hosts (about seven minutes, cross toolchains on PATH)
bunx biome check --write                  # format and fix (src, test, tools, the JSON configs)
bun run typecheck:test                    # tsc over test/*.ts
docker compose -f test/docker/compose.yaml run --rm <alpine-x64|alpine-i386|win7|vista|xp> <command>   # emulated environments
```

The repository is installed and driven with Bun (`bun.lock`). The scripts are plain `tsc` and `node` commands, so `npm run`,
`pnpm run` and `yarn` run the same ones from a `package.json` install of any of them; only the lockfile is
Bun's. `bun test` is Bun's own runner, not this suite: use `bun run test`.

Biome uses tabs, line width 120. `dist/` is committed: run `bun run build` before committing.

## Definition of done

Run the whole chain; a red check means fix and re-run all of it. Never call something done with a failing or skipped-when-it-should-run check.

1. `bunx biome check --write`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run typecheck:test`, `bun run build`.
2. The suite that covers the change while iterating, then the **full** `bun run test` before reporting.
3. **Runtime changes** (`quickjs/runtime`): the matching differential corpus in `test/fixtures/web` must print exactly what Node.js
   prints. New behaviour gets a corpus line, and the corpus is added to `DIFFERENTIAL` in `test/webRuntime.test.ts`.
4. **C changes** (`quickjs/native`, `winxp-compat.patch`): `bun run prebuilts`, commit the regenerated hosts, then run the Wine tests.
   Batch all C changes for a work session into ONE prebuilt rebuild.
5. **Windows-facing changes**: the Wine and Docker tests (`fg-wine` image: the Windows hosts and single-file builds) are part
   of the bar and must actually run, not skip. Check an executable's imports (`objdump -p`) before claiming an old-Windows fix.
6. **Packaging changes**: build a real fixture and run the output, with no Node.js on the path where the target is the Graak engine.

Baselines: check corpora against **Node.js 24.21.0 (LTS)** and **26.9.0 (Current)**. Where they differ, say which one a
behaviour follows. Node 26's ICU aborts the process on some option mixes (era, numeric date and weekday in `de-CH`), so a corpus
must not contain them.

## Intl on the host

`quickjs/runtime/intl.js` (engine) and `intl-zone.js` (calendar and POSIX-TZ math) run over data generated from Node's own ICU by
`tools/gen-intl-data.js` (plus `gen-intl-collation.js`): `intl-data.js` (shared), `intl-<tag>.js` (formats), `intl-names-<tag>.js`.
Do not edit the generated files; change the generator and regenerate.

```sh
INTL_ZONE_CACHE=/tmp/zones.json node tools/gen-intl-data.js   # zone sampling from ICU is ~80 s; the cache skips it
```

Delete the cache when zone logic changes. While iterating, narrow `LOCALES` to a few tags and restore all 39 before the final run.
Verify with `intl-corpus.cjs` and `intl-fuzz.cjs` (in `DIFFERENTIAL`). Builds ship the data only when the program mentions Intl or
the locale-aware built-ins (`--intl auto|all|none`).

## Scope discipline (read before chasing a diff)

- The stopping rule for a compatibility area is **zero diff on realistic use**, not on every combination ICU or Node accepts.
  Odd option mixes, one-off quirks (a V8 `resolvedOptions()` oddity, a zone's generic name) go in the README's known gaps, not
  into hours of work.
- Prefer the smallest change that makes real packages (Express, Fastify, Hono, ws, discord.js, undici, native addons) work.
- Do not add features, options or abstractions nobody asked for. Match the surrounding code, comment density and naming.

## Git

- Commit locally after the checks are green, one milestone per commit, conventional prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`,
  `chore:`). Do not push unless the user asks. Never rewrite pushed history.
- Commit messages and docs are written in normal prose, whatever the chat style is.
- Never commit credentials, tokens or passwords, and never use one pasted in a conversation.
- Deploys, database writes, secrets and anything hard to reverse: confirm first.

## Working in parallel

Independent gaps can be worked at the same time by separate agents, each in its own git worktree or branch: TLS client options,
`dns`, Brotli, DH/ECDH, HTTP/2, `node:test`. Rules:

- Two agents never edit the same file set. `quickjs/native/*`, `quickjs/prebuilt/*`, the generated `intl-*.js` files and
  `dist/` are single-writer: one agent owns them at a time, and the C work of all agents is merged before the one prebuilt rebuild.
- Each agent finishes its own definition of done (above) before handing back, and reports what it ran and what it saw.
- The integrating agent runs the full `bun run test`, including the Wine and Docker tests, on the merged result.

## Traps already paid for

- When patching a file with a script, read that file into the variable you write back. Writing a stale variable overwrote
  `README.md` once; `git diff --stat` after every scripted edit catches it.
- Wait on a marker your own run writes after you clear it, not on a file a previous run left behind.
- `pkill -f <pattern>` kills your own shell if the pattern is in its command line.
- A generated file, a manifest hash and `dist/` all go stale silently: regenerate, rebuild, then test.
- `es-419`-style tags have a numeric region: patterns that assume two capital letters miss them.
- Windows before 10 has no AF_UNIX; UDP, sockets and libuv-shaped calls need their own emulation there. Look at
  `quickjs/native/win-compat` before assuming a POSIX call exists.

## Open work

TLS client options, Brotli/Zstd, `crypto` DH/ECDH/primes/X509, HTTP/2, `v8.Serializer`, `URLPattern`, the libuv subset on
Windows, cluster, wasi, repl and inspector are all closed; see the README's per-module rows for what each one covers and its
own small known gaps. `createSign`/`createVerify`/`crypto.sign`/`crypto.verify` with a BLAKE2 digest now match Node for RSA,
classic DSA (both reject it) and ECDSA (Node signs and verifies with it like any other digest, and so does the host: the
digest is computed in JavaScript and handed to mbedTLS as already-hashed bytes, since mbedTLS's own digest table has no
BLAKE2 entry to compute it from the name). `node:test`'s `mock.module` now covers ESM `import`/`import()` as well as
CommonJS `require()`: the engine's native module loader (`fg_sea_module_loader` in `quickjs/native/fg_sea.c`, the only
module loader installed and not SEA-only) calls back into JS for every import, and a mock hit is compiled the same way
a real file is. Two narrow gaps remain, both because quickjs caches a loaded module by specifier at the engine level
before the loader runs, and nothing outside quickjs.c can evict that cache: `cache: false` behaves like `cache: true`
for ESM, and mocking a specifier some earlier import already resolved has no effect there (real Node's own loader can
do both; this one can't without patching the vendored engine). Mocking before the first import of a specifier, the
normal pattern, is unaffected by either.

What is genuinely still absent, not just narrowed: `node:sqlite` extension loading (`enableLoadExtension`/`loadExtension` —
`backup()` and `function()` are both implemented: `backup()` is rate-limited `sqlite3_backup_step` stepping driven from
JavaScript, with `progress`, `source`/`target` and Node's own validation and error shapes; `function()` binds a scalar SQL
function through `sqlite3_create_function_v2()`, with a C trampoline into JavaScript —
`sqlite3_value*` args converted to JSValues, `JS_Call`, the JSValue result converted back with `sqlite3_result_*` — and
Node's own argument coercion, `deterministic`/`directOnly`/`varargs`/`useBigIntArguments` options and error propagation.
Loading extensions needs neither: the bundled amalgamation is compiled with `SQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION`, and a static
host has no `dlopen` to load one with regardless — the same limit as native addon loading below); the inspector's `Profiler`,
`HeapProfiler` and `Debugger` domains (quickjs has no debugger protocol or profiler to back them); and native addon
loading on a static host (no dynamic loader there — the packager falls back to a dynamic host automatically). The legacy
Windows path comes first.
